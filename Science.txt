SCIENTIFIC METHOD!!!

Models to try / Tested? / Results

A. Preprocessing (simple):
1: FFT over entire 10 min sample, then get rear/mag /power - MM
2: linearity bad. Reduce features (pca, smoothing, manual decimation) -MM
3. Use pre-existing naive feature vectorizer NFV- MM
AA. (more advanced)
1. Hilbert transform on the data before FFT - MM
2. Frequency correlation (to be determined method) - MM

B. Non-NN Models:
1: SVN on NFV vectors - MM



C. Neural networks
1: take FFT, concat all the electrodes, feed into MLP (sigmoid). Dense 3 layer, 1-hot output. - AL
2: same as C.1, but with convo, max pooling instead of dimensionality reduction - AL
3: naive feature vector maker (1600 per slice). feed into MLP as above. -AL
4: NFV and use deep belief network (needs extensions) - AL

CC. Moar Neural Networks (eventually)
1: RNN on chunked FFTs
2: Convo over timeseries/electrode dimension
