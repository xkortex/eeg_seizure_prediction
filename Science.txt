SCIENTIFIC METHOD!!!

Models to try / Tested? / Results

Preprocessing:
1: FFT over entire 10 min sample, then get rear/mag /power
2: linearity bad. Reduce features (pca, smoothing, manual decimation) 


1: take FFT, concat all the electrodes, feed into MLP (sigmoid). Dense 3 layer, 1-hot output. 
option 2: same, but with convo, max pooling instead of dimensionality reduction
option 3: noob feature vector maker (1600 per slice). feed into MLP as above.
option 4: NFV and use deep belief network (needs extensions)
